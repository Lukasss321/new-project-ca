# Getting Started with NEW-PROJECT-CA


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: npm start to run both the backend and frontend.

# Steps to run backend:
1. cd backend 
2. npm start
# Steps to run frontend:
1. cd frontend
2. cd last-dance
3. npm start

Since the project is organized into separate folders for the frontend and backend, please access each folder separately and run npm start to ensure that both the frontend and backend are fully functional and running. This will ensure that the application is fully operational.

## Application's Usability
The application is designed for employees to register their company's clients into the database. It provides functional Register and Login forms, as well as Add-Customer and Customer-list features, which ensure that the entered data is registered and saved into the database.
